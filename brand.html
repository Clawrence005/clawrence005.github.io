    <h3>The Benefits of a Well-Designed Homepage</h3>
    A simple homepage design welcomes your audience to your site, tells them what you want them to do next, and
    allows them to explore your site in more depth.

    You can layer on more complexity, but you don’t want to start with a cluttered mess and have to selectively prune
    it. Always begin with the basics. When you begin planning out your homepage design, make sure every element
    satisfies at least one of the following four goals.
    <ul>
      <li>You can add complexity to a simple homepage design, but you don’t want to start with a cluttered mess and
        have to selectively prune it. Always begin with the basics.
      </li>
      <li>
        What do you need on your homepage? What will your audience expect? And which elements take priority?
      </li>
      <li>
        When you can answer those questions, you’ll have the information you need for better homepage design. In web
        design, homepage elements have very specific purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Helping your target audience get to know your business
        Many of your website visitors will find your homepage first. With that in mind, you need to make a solid
        first impression.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your homepage should provide a sense of your company’s values, unique selling proposition (USP), and purpose.
        You’re more likely to lure in potential customers if you can effectively communicate this information.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Improving the user experience on your website</h3>
    Consumers visit your website with a purpose. It could be to check out your product line, read your blog posts, or
    find out if you sell a particular type of service.

    Regardless, you want to direct that consumer to the appropriate page. Your homepage design should facilitate this
    transition by providing intuitive navigation and a sense of how your website flows.

    <h3>Accruing more conversions</h3>
    You want website visitors to convert, but they won’t if you don’t give them the necessary incentive and
    opportunity. Maybe you want to build an email list, but if visitors can’t find a signup form, your database will
    remain empty.

    By making this information easily accessible on your homepage, you will see an uptick in conversions.

    Another way to boost conversions is to create a strong first impression with your homepage. If visitors enjoy
    their experience on your website, they’ll also be more likely to remember it in the future. Maybe you won’t make
    a sale today, but that customer will return days or weeks later and buy from you.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Improving brand awareness</h3>
    Make your company memorable by allowing your brand image and messaging to come through on every page. This is
    especially true when it comes to your homepage design because the homepage serves as the gateway to the rest of
    your website.

    Your logo, tagline, and purpose need to take center stage. In fact, you might even want to add a form or
    statement to the very top of your homepage — preferably in a large font — that gives your visitors a sense of
    what you do:

    What problems do you solve for your customers? How do you improve your clients’ lives — whether personal or
    professional?

    Don’t force your website audience to have to figure out and guess what it is you do. Make it clear from the get
    go.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>How to Design a Website Homepages</h3>
    Now that you know the four goals to motivate your design principles, ask yourself three guiding questions: What
    do you absolutely need on your homepage? Who is your target audience and what will they expect? Which elements
    take priority?

    Once you have the answers to these three questions, you can begin plotting out how best to improve your homepage.
    Remember to tie each of your design elements to one of the four goals listed above. Most importantly, don’t worry
    about getting it perfect. Website optimization is an ongoing process!

  <h3>Homepage Design Best Practices in 2018: Checklist</h3>
  Now that we’ve looked at some of the best homepage designs in 2018, I’ll leave you with a handy checklist that you
  can follow when creating your own.
  <h4>
    Clear</h4>
  <li>
    You’ve established your USP and purpose. Visitors know what you do and what sets you apart from the competition.
  </li>
  <h4>
    Dynamic</h4>
  <li>
    Visitors can engage with different elements on the homepage, such as links, forms, and expandable content.</li>

  <h4>Contrasting colours</h4>
  <li>
    You use strong color choices to direct your visitors’ eyes where you want them to go. Links, calls-to-action, and
    headlines should stand out on the page.
  </li>
  <h4>Loads fast</h4>
  <li>
    The best homepage design is lean and quick. It should load in just a few seconds so your visitors don’t get tired
    of waiting and click or tap away.
  </li>
  <h4>Attractive copy</h4>
  <li>
    Don’t be boring! Use creative language to convey important ideas and to lure your visitors further into your
    site.
  </li>
  <h4>Good navigation</h4>
  <li>
    You answer the question: “Where do I go from here?” Top and side navigation bars are common amongst good homepage
    design examples.
  </li>
  <h4>Mobile-friendly</h4>
  <li>
    If your visitors access your site via a small device, they can use it just as effectively as they could if they
    used a desktop or laptop computer.
  </li>
  <h4>Relevant calls-to-action</h4>
  <li>
    Your website leaves no room for misunderstandings when it comes to what you want visitors to do. Your
    call-to-action uses strong verbs and adjectives to compel visitors to click.</li>

  <h4>Engaging</h4>
  <li>
    Again, don’t be boring! Interesting copy, lively visuals, and unique layouts can all convince website visitors to
    stick around — and to come back later.</li>

  <p>Streamlined: The best layouts for marketing contain zero fluff or clutter. In fact, many of the best layouts
    make use of lots of white or negative space, which is shown to have positive impacts on users.</p>
